    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our college allotment predictor project! Our team of developers and data scientists have created a tool that aims to make the college admission process easier for students.
    </p><p>We understand that applying to colleges can be a daunting task, especially when it comes to predicting which colleges you're likely to get admitted into. That's where our predictor comes in. Using a combination of historical admission data, current application trends, and machine learning algorithms, we're able to provide you with personalized predictions of your chances of getting admitted into different colleges.</p>
    
    <p>Our team has spent countless hours researching and analyzing admission data from a variety of colleges and universities across the country. We've also consulted with admissions officers and college counselors to ensure that our predictor is as accurate and reliable as possible.</p>
    
    <p>But we know that college admissions is about more than just numbers and statistics. That's why our tool also takes into account your individual preferences and priorities, such as location, academic interests, and extracurricular activities. We want to help you find the colleges that are the best fit for you, both academically and personally.</p>
    
    <p>Our team is committed to continuously improving and updating our predictor as new data becomes available and admission trends change. We believe that everyone should have access to the information they need to make informed decisions about their education and future.</p>
    
    <p>Thank you for choosing our college allotment predictor project, and we wish you the best of luck in your college admissionsÂ journey!</p>
